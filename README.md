### NYC Parking Violations
> For this project, we will analyze millions of NYC Parking violations since January 2016.

## Part 1: Python Scripting
> In the first part, we simply want to develop a python command line interface that can connect to the OPCV API and demonstrate that the data is accessible via python.

> The script must be able to run within docker but take parameters from the command line. It should also support having the option to print results out to a file.
